My second assignment for SYST24444 at Sheridan College

The porject was to use JQuery Mobile and AJAX to pull information from a JSON file and display it on screen dynamically as the user selects it.
It was designed to be viewed on a cell phone, more specifiaclly on a iPhone SE and iPhoneXR.
There is currently a running version at: http://wyrobap.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/SYST24444/Assignment2/
